# Token Embedding Transformer

## 📌 Summary
This project demonstrates how text is transformed into tokens and embeddings using Transformer models.  
It visualizes how input words are tokenized, mapped to token IDs, and represented in vector space.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a tool that helps understand how tokenization and embeddings work in LLMs, using visual plots for better interpretability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- Scikit-learn (PCA / t-SNE for dimensionality reduction)  
- Matplotlib  

## 🚀 Applications
- Educational tool for learning about embeddings  
- Demonstrating LLM internals in classrooms/workshops  
- Quick experiment hub for token-level analysis  

## 🔮 Future Use
- Extend to multiple models and compare embeddings  
- Add clustering and semantic similarity visualization  
- Deploy as a web app for interactive exploration
